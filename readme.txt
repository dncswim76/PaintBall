Brian Walsh, I made the pythonUI to put the user interface
directory files in.

Brian Ip, I made the tranceiver directory for you to
work with the communication stuff.

For those of you that don't know how to use git:

     On the right of the webpage you should be able to copy the pointer
     to the git repository

     then say in linux command line:
     git clone <paste here> <choose a local repo name>

     you can make changes to the code that is there, but to update the version
     say:

     git commit -am "some message of what you changed"
         **This only updates locally on your machine, not in the repo
           found online**

     to update to everyone else say:

     git push origin master

     if you add a file:

     git add <path to file/name of file>
